			<h1> Repentance: </h1>
		</header>
		<article>
			<p> Repentance is the act of acknowledging
				sins, asking for forgiveness, and turning from them. It is a state of the soul that is granted by God,
				and you simply cannot repent by just saying sorry and then further continuing in sin. <br> It is a death of the old man.

			<h1> Baptism: </h1>
		</header>

		<article>
			<p> Baptism is a symbol of burial and birth(will discuss birth in the next web page): <br><br>
        You bury the old man, and your sins. It essentially washes you clean of all your sins, and makes you a new man. You start with a new slate and your sins are no longer on your record. This means God does not remember them anymore. It is a remission of sins.

			<p> The Gift of the Holy Ghost is the Lord's Spirit
				coming down from heaven and coming to live
				on the inside of you. <br> <br>

        The way you will know He is living in you
				<br> is when you start to speak in an unknown language according to <strong> Acts 2:4.<br></strong> The
				Lord's spirit will manifest inside you and
				give you the power over: <br> <br>
				<strong> Flesh <br> Devils <br> And Much More</strong>
